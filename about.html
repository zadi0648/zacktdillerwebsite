      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <br>
      <p id="norm">I have lived in Colorado my whole life. I grew up in old house in Parker that has the shape of an octagon, which sits on top of a hill and as so has one of the best views in Colorado. When I'm not indulging myself in technology you may find me running outdoors or working out at the local gym, but most of the time I am indeed indulging myself in technology. Aside from that I love skiing and scuba diving whenever I can, and learning something everyday from the internet's huge collection of information.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Computer Science</h2>
      <br>
      <p id="norm">I first started programming in my highschool sophmore year. As a child the computer always fascinated me, my parents always knew I would be a computer guy. I am always curious as to how the computer does all of its neat tricks when I don't already know. My father is a geophysicist and one of the best programmers in his field. He has always been an inspiration for me. Programming is one of life's greatest pleasures for me, for I love puzzle solving and constructing which programming is all about.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Video Games</h2>
      <br>
      <p id="norm">Brace yourself, for I love talking about video games. I remember the first time I laid eyes on a video game. It was a racing simulator on my uncle's computer at his house. I was entranced just watching him play, the idea of having control over a virtual world within a computer amazed me. I was captivated just watching. When he handed control over to me my mind was blown, the idea of be a part of this virtual world was incredible. Aside from, that my earliest memories of gaming was playing Super Mario Bros. with my cousin on his NES and playing Putt-Putt on my family's computer. It wasn't long until I got my hands on advanced games, namely a widely unknown game bought for my older brother called Urban Assualt in 1998. Its intense opening video clip of an alien invasion apocalypse made a lasting impression on me, and I continued to save the world many times over.</p>
      <p id="norm">I don't just pride myself on being a programmer, but a game designer. As I play a game I often find myself thinking how I would have designed the game differently, what I would have added, and what I think the designer did right. For this reason I generally enjoy playing games that have a lot of potential but didn't reach it because they stimulate my imagination when I think of what could have been. I think deeply about what makes the game fun and what emotions the game brings about. Once in highschool I spent a long time compiling a massive list of ideas I had for the Gears of War franchise. This was combined with a few ideas from other 'gear heads', which can be found <a href="https://forums.epicgames.com/threads/725145-%E2%98%85-The-Gears-of-War-3-Fan-Idea-List-%E2%98%85-5-Extra-Months!-POST-YOUR-IDEAS-HERE!!!!!">here</a>. It's a shame the images are no longer up, because I spent a long time on them to convey my ideas and they really made the list fun to look at. I submitted it soon after Gears of War 3 was announced, but by then Epic Games officials stated it was already too late in the development cycle to implement major features. Epic Games personally sent me a box of things for the creation of this huge list of ideas, which included a free copy of UT3, comic books, hats, and more. Some of the features mentioned in the list actually did make it in the final game, but it is unclear how big of an influence my list actually had.</p>
      <p id="norm">What I love most about video games is two things: how they allow us to escape our daily lives and partake in a fantasy world and how a video game can be so much more complex and full of possibilities than any game in real life could be. For me the most important part of a video game is the gameplay. But it certiantly isn't sole determining factor of what makes a game good. I play every type of video game there is. My seven all-time favorite and most played video games in order are: Unreal Tournament 1999, Age of Mythology, League of Legends, Rome: Total War, the first three Halo games, Rollercoaster Tycoon, and the first three Gears of War games.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>CU Game Developer's Club Co-President</h2>
      <br>
      <p id="norm">This is my third year sharing the presidency of the club with Trystan Binkley-Jones, another enthusiastic game developer. The main purpose of the club is to provide a place for aspiring game developers to meet up and build connections. We meet weekly in the enginnering center. What we do at meetings differs time to time. Sometimes we give a tutorial on a popular game engine or 3D modeling/animation software. Sometimes we have a member pitch a game idea or show off a completed project. Sometimes we have an open discussion about a certian topic in the video game industry. We often have free food at meetings which is funded by our sponsors. We encourage members to not be shy and show off their work. Everyone is welcomed regardless of their experience.</p>
