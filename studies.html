      <p id="norm">Advanced practicum in which students design, implement, document and test software systems for use in industry, non-profits, government and research institutions. Also offers extensive experience in oral and written communication throughout the development process.</p>
      <p id="norm">For my project I am on the Tweeting Plants team. We have a Raspberry Pi inside a greenhouse that mesaures various things such as temperature, moisture, and humidity. Using this information and natural language processing we create a short message that sums up each day which is posted to twitter. It is important each message is unique enough to seem human. The information is all posted on our groups website, found <a href="http://www.microveggies.com/">here</a>.</p>
      <br>
